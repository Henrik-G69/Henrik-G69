👋 Hello, World! I'm Henrik! :)
🌱 I'm a college student of IS with a keen interest in AI development. I'm passionate about learning and expanding my skills,
and I'm excited to collaborate with the open-source community on GitHub.
👀 I have experience with HTML, CSS, and Python, and I'm always looking for opportunities to apply my programming skills to real-world projects.
💞️ In my free time, I enjoy playing chess, listening to jazz music, exploring 80s songs, and watching classic Hollywood movies.
📫 Feel free to connect with me on Discord (henrik369) or drop me a message via email (henrikclement369@gmail.com). Let's chat and see how we can work together!
